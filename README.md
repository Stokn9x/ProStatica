# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
- 


You have to install this https://nodejs.org/en after installing restart your IDE and run the code "npm install" and now it should be ready
Hey to start the page, go into powershell aka console, and type "npm run dev" and a localhost will launch. 

Server side setup. 
If you want to use the server for sign-up page do this
npm install express body-parser
npm install cors

then navigate to the server folder "cd src" then "cd server" 
When you are in the server folder type "node server.js" 
Then the server is running 
Obs to also have to run the normal web page to use the server so aka launch both ones.
